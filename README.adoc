== Spring-Boot Camel QuickStart using ConfigMaps and Secrets

$ cd my_openshift/spring-boot-camel-config
----

. Create the (**required**) secret:
+
----
$ oc create -f sample-secret.yml
----

. Create the ConfigMap (the ConfigMap can be also created after the application has been deployed, to see the live-reload feature in action):
+
----
$ oc create -f sample-configmap.yml
----

. Build and deploy the project to the OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean -DskipTests fabric8:deploy -Popenshift
----

. In your browser, navigate to the `MY_PROJECT_NAME` project in the OpenShift console.
Wait until you can see that the pod for the `spring-boot-camel-config` has started up.

. On the project's `Overview` page, navigate to the details page deployment of the `spring-boot-config` application: `https://OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR:8443/console/project/MY_PROJECT_NAME/browse/rc/spring-boot-camel-config-NUMBER_OF_DEPLOYMENT?tab=details`.
